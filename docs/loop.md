# The loop

One process improves a repository by picking an issue, dispatching an author,
getting an independent review, landing a PR through hosted CI, and moving on.
It starts on this repository and then runs Chase Sets through an adapter. New
capability is added only when a real cycle records a blocker.

## Rules

1. The loop is `scripts/dogfood/`. Its entry point is `loop:supervise` in
   `package.json`, which accepts one loop config and derives each phase.
2. An issue is runnable when it is open, labeled `ready`, every `blocked_by`
   in its draft is closed, and it belongs to the earliest open milestone.
3. Authors run `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm format:check` and `pnpm test` in their
   worktree before handing off. The hosted three-OS `bootstrap` workflow is
   the only required check on a PR.
4. Review is a verdict (PASS or FAIL), findings with `file:line`, and a G0
   answer: is there a simpler way. A blocking finding fails the review. Two
   blocking rounds force a third repair that applies the reviewer's prescribed
   fixes verbatim.
5. Transient failures get one automatic retry inside the same attempt: a
   failed typecheck or format gate, an unparsable verdict, a delayed exit
   receipt. Four attempts per issue, then stop.
6. Authority does not move. Workers never push, publish, merge, or edit the
   running loop. The executor is the checked-out stable `main`. The author
   never reviews its own work.
7. A stop caused by the work parks the issue with one paragraph: what stopped
   it, how many attempts, what a person should change, and how to unpark it;
   the loop then continues with the next runnable issue. A stop caused by the
   host or executor posts its paragraph without parking and exits. A recurring
   note becomes the next issue. That is the only intake.
8. Runtime state lives outside the checkout.
9. A restart may repeat the last in-flight step at the cost of one worker
   launch. Records exist so the loop can resume, not to prove anything to a
   second process: there is one operator, one host, and one writer. A check
   that guards against a hostile state directory, a hand-edited receipt, or
   the loop disagreeing with itself is a finding, not a safeguard.

## Planning

`planning/roadmap.json` registers milestones and issues. Each issue has a
draft at `planning/drafts/<key>.md`:

```md
---
key: ISS-123
title: "Short imperative title"
labels: ["type:slice", "ready"]
milestone: "Exact milestone title"
blocked_by: [ISS-120, ISS-121]
---

## Why

## Done when

## Out of scope
```

`pnpm planning:check` proves drafts and roadmap agree and the graph is
acyclic. `pnpm planning:board-check` proves every open registered issue on
GitHub carries the marker, the draft link and the verbatim draft, has the
right milestone, and sits on the delivery project once. Closed issues are
history and are not compared. The GitHub issue body is:

```md
<!-- planning-key: ISS-123 -->

Source draft: [`planning/drafts/ISS-123.md`](https://github.com/todd-skelton/orchestration-platform/blob/main/planning/drafts/ISS-123.md)

<verbatim draft>
```

To add work: write the draft, register it, create the issue with that body and
milestone, add it to the project, label it `ready` when unblocked. To park
work: close the issue with a note; leave nothing registered.

## Running

The loop runs on the WSL Ubuntu executor, not on Windows. The Windows Codex
sandbox refuses piped child output and its elevated setup needs a UAC prompt
that never completed, so the executor has its own Git 2.53, Node 24, pnpm,
`gh` and Codex CLI under `/root/orchestration-m1/tools`. Windows is covered by
hosted CI only.

- Executor checkout: `/root/orchestration-m1/repo` (this repository).
- Config: `/root/orchestration-m1/loop.json`; state under
  `/root/orchestration-m1/runtime/<run>`; worktrees under
  `/root/orchestration-m1/worktrees`; log `/root/orchestration-m1/supervisor.log`.
- Start from Windows (the launcher detaches itself and prints the PID):
  `wsl -d Ubuntu -- bash /root/orchestration-m1/run-loop.sh [config.json]`
- Check: `wsl -d Ubuntu -- tail -n 3 /root/orchestration-m1/supervisor.log`.
  A final `idle` line means nothing is `ready`; a non-zero exit means a stop
  whose learning note is on the issue.
- Workers read `/root/orchestration-m1/codex-home/config.toml`, the executor's
  own Codex home, so that file selects the model provider. It routes through
  the local subscription pool on the Windows host, which listens on
  `127.0.0.1:8317` only, so `scripts/executor/pool-bridge.mjs` forwards the
  WSL-facing host address to it. Start the loop with
  `scripts/executor/start-loop.ps1` from Windows: it starts the bridge when
  needed, and the launcher refuses to start without it. No worker holds a
  native Codex login.
- Chase Sets runs use `/root/orchestration-m2/repo` and
  `/root/orchestration-m2/loop.json` with the same tools (ISS-110).

| Key | Title                       | Exit evidence                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| --- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| M1  | Unattended self-improvement | Three consecutive useful issues on this repo land through one `supervise` invocation with no per-item host script or manual step. The report states whether an automatic retry or restart occurred; planned restart recovery is separate. |
| M2  | Chase Sets delivery adapter | One low-risk Chase Sets milestone is delivered end to end through the loop with a `chase-sets` adapter.                                                                                                                                   |
| M3  | Chase Sets adoption         | Routine Chase Sets delivery runs on the platform; the `milestone-orchestrator` host loop is retired for routine work with a rollback.                                                                                                     |
